# Real-time Feed Ranking Engine (Prototype)

**Language:** C++20  
**Focus:** Low-latency, modular feed ranking pipeline

## Overview
This is a prototype for a real-time feed ranking engine inspired by social media platforms (Meta, Instagram, TikTok).  
It demonstrates a clean, modular pipeline:

1. Candidate generation  
2. Feature extraction / online feature store  
3. Scoring / ranking  
4. Re-ranking & caching  

The project focuses on **performance, low-latency architecture, and scalable design**.
